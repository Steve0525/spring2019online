This week we talked a bit about iterative design, then the final project, and
ended with discussion about the Idyll framework.

# Outline of Topics

This week our objectives will be to (1) spend more time looking at different kinds of map visualizations, (2) we'll introduce the topics of networks and think about how to visualize them.

Map Viz Motivation: <a href="https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/08/02/5-provocative-map-data-visualizations/">examples of mappable data</a> and <a href="https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/08/02/5-provocative-map-data-visualizations/">even more examples of data on maps</a>.

Network Viz Motivation: <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Mathhorizons/NetworkofThrones%20%281%29.pdf">social networks</a> and <a href="https://dataviz.tools/category/network-visualization/">many network viz platforms</a>.
