# Week 10 - Iterative Design, Idyll

This week we talked a bit about iterative design, then the final project, and
ended with discussion about the Idyll framework.

# Resources

 * <a href='corg/imgcropped.png' download>Example image to download for Idyll build</a>
 * <a href='data/corgiData.json' download>Example dataset for Idyll build</a>

# Beginning Idyll code

 * We will be heavily modifying you're default : the <a href="idyll_website/index.idyll" download>index.idyll</a> file.  I've included my notes in that download if its easier to follow along that way.

# Final Project Resources

 * Google doc of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15UJinT5XokAHXd9fQAYD8f6d3vEkR6kJMq8kswmkOhY/edit?usp=sharing">available datasets</a>.  Feel free to use one of your own!
 
# Outline of Topics

This week our objectives will be to (1) think about how we construct visualizations based on our audiences, (2) discuss the final project, (3) start working on publishing some visualizations with Idyll, (4) have a brief introduction to the concept of scientific visualization.

We introduce Idyll this week and continue on with more Idyll next week.


 * Lecture
   1. Distinction of "viz for self", "viz for peers/experts", "viz for others/outreach/public"
   1. Storytelling and knowing your audience
   1. Visualizations for the web - overview of html/D3.js/etc

 * Programming
   1. Introduction to scientific visualization with Python and [yt](https://yt-project.org/) - how to get data and simple plots (we'll cover this more later, but if you want to use some sci viz for your final project we'll go through the basics)
   1. Introduction to some command line tools
   1. Introduction to Idyll
   1. Introduction to vega-lite in Idyll
