## Questions To Ask

* Do I know anything about the data?
  * What form will it take?
  * What tale do I think it will tell?
* How should I present this data?
  * Can the data be reconstructed from my visualization?
  * What technical issues impede clarity?
  * Am I providing visual context?
* How will this visualization be received?
  * What implicit or explicit assumptions am I making about the observer?
  * What questions will they ask of it?
  * Do I have empathy for my viewer?

Let's return to that visualization.

Do you know how to build something like that?

What tools could you use?

Where would you put it?

## Publishing Pages

GitHub pages is a simple, straightforward way to publish websites.

 * Static-site generation using Jekyll
 * Manual HTML building
 * Integration with other systems (Idyll)

---

## Publishing Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks can be published online.  The simplest way:

 * Commit them to a github repository
 * View them using nbviewer.jupyter.org

Widget state can be saved in many cases.
